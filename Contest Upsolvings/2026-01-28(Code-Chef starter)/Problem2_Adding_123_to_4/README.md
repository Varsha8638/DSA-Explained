# Adding 123 to 4 – Maximum Pair Finder

## Problem Statement
You are given several pieces of paper with numbers written on them:  

- `X` papers with **1** written on them  
- `Y` papers with **2** written on them  
- `Z` papers with **3** written on them  

You want to pair **two pieces of paper** such that the sum of numbers on each pair equals **4**.  

Your task is to calculate the **maximum number of such pairs** you can form.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.  
- Each of the next `T` lines contains three integers: `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.

---

## Output Format

- For each test case, output a single line containing the **maximum number of pairs** that sum to 4.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 100`  
- `1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 100`
